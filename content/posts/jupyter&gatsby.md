<challenge id="1" title="test">

This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown – so
you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
the one for the instructions below.

- These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
- The code block below will look for the files 
  <codeblock source="exc_01_01_01">
  </codeblock>
  
</challenge>

To prevent this, I've included some vanilla JavaScript that you can insert in your index.html just after the <body> tag. It is in a file named noflash.js.txt. You can either insert the contents of this file in a <script> tag or automate the step in your build process.

Note that if you change any of the default—such as storageKey or classNameDark for example—the noflash.js file will need to be modified with the same values.
